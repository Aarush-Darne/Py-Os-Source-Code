# Hi!
This repl is an Oparative System called Py OS. It's called Py OS because, as you can guess, it was developed with python.

# Discription :
**Py OS has 85% no errors in finished apps.** Please tell me if you find an error in an app please tell me how you found it.

**Note :** After using Firefox you'll need to refresh the tab in order to use the OS again. I've been left to assume this is a bug with Replit, not Py OS

**Need help?** A few things you should know before using Py OS :
- The default password is "a"
- Type any app name to open it (even if you type "PyThOn" it will open python)
- On a mac you still use "ctrl+c" (not "cmd+c") to exit python

**Apps :**
- Firefox
- Chrome
- Wikipedia
- Python
- Terminal
- TicTacToe *`Could contain bugs...`*
- Settings **`New!`** *`Could contain bugs...`*
- MyFiles **`New!`** *`Could contain bugs...`*

**Yet to be added :**
- Saving

> **Have ideas?** Why not comment them and have them added to the Repl?


# So... What's next?
If you wanted you could fork this repl and customize this to make it your own. Remember to make your version of Py OS creative. Or you could use this repl as an inspiration for your own Repl


> **Sugestions and bugs :** Feel free to comment any sugestions or in the comments so I can add them to Py OS in the future. If you found a bug please tell me
